# 🌿 Plant Disease Detection System

This project is an AI-powered web application designed to detect plant diseases from leaf images. It employs a deep learning model to classify diseases in various plant species. The front-end provides an intuitive interface for users to upload images, while the back-end processes them using a trained neural network.

## 🚀 Features

- 🌱 **Plant Selection**: Choose from various plant types before uploading an image.
- 📸 **Image Upload**: Supports `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, and `.png` files.
- 🧠 **AI-Based Disease Detection**: Uses a TensorFlow-based deep learning model for predictions.
- 📊 **User-Friendly Interface**: Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- 🎭 **Streamlit Dashboard**: Provides a simple UI for disease prediction.
